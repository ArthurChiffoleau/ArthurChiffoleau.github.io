            <p> Description of the project

                Madlads is a mobile strategy game, where you move and use towers to support you minions to fight against the enemy minions.
                The goal of the game is to make your minions reach the enemy base so they can destroy it while preventing the enemy from doing the same.
                Your minions are organised in squad of four, you can choose the archetypes that will compose upcomming squads and their route. When they have spawned you cannot control them directly but you can support them with towers that can help them by buffing them, debuff the enemies, make damage to the enemeies or transport them; the tower cannot do any damge to enemy base.
                The tower are placed on rail and can be move along them to follow the minions (or to transport them), you control 3 or 4 towers. The tower have passive part that work when the tower is in range of targets and part that need an activation from player that unleash diverse ability.
                The challenges are to compose good squad of minion that will counter the enemy, choose route that will allow minion to encounter enemies at good position, support with the good tower in strategic position and use the ability of the tower effeciently.
